# Tonalyze
Tonalyze extracts audio data from youtube, souncloud and instagram and then analyzes the tonal key and an estimated bpm of the track.

## How to build

As this is a single file app, create a console project in visual studio or any other IDE and then include the "App.cs" file to compile with the project. After building extract the bin.rar provided in the Dependencies folder, and place the bin folder in the release or debug folder.

Watch the video example where i setup the project and then run it to extract and analyze some audio file from youtube.

If you want to just use the app directly from releases, skip to 2:15 and there you can see the commands available.
